@doc The erlsvn application allows you to do advanced rewriting of a
Subversion dump file.

Erlsvn basically tracks the entire Subversion history while processing the
input, in order to ensure that the new dump file is self-consistent and can
be successfully loaded into a repository.

Use the {@link testfilter} and {@link svndump_filter} modules as a starting
point for writing your own filter functions. The data structures are
described in the `include/svndump.hrl' file.
